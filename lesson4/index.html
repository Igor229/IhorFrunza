                    Beavers are well-adapted for semi-aquatic life, 
                    with thick waterproof fur, a flattened tail that acts as a rudder, 
                    and closable nostrils and ears, as well as a transparent eye membrane.
                    Beavers are among the largest living rodents in the world.
                    They have thick fur, webbed feet and flattened, scale-covered tails. 
                    With powerful jaws and strong teeth, they fell trees in order to build homes and dams, 
                    often changing their environment in ways few other animals can. In fact, 
                    the idioms "busy as a beaver" and "eager beaver" are synonymous with being industrious and hardworking.

                    There are only two species of beaver. The American beaver(opens in new tab) 
                    (Castor canadensis) typically weighs 60 lbs. (27 kilograms) and are 23 to 39 inches 
                    (60 to 100 centimeters) long. The tail adds another 7.75 to 12 inches (20 to 30.5 cm) 
                    to its length, according to National Geographic.

                    Beavers have large teeth. Their upper incisors are from 20 to 25 mm long, 
                    according to ADW. They continue to grow throughout a beaver's lifetime. 
                    Beavers have adapted to a semi-aquatic existence with closable nostrils and ears, 
                    and transparent eye membranes. Both male and female beavers have a pair of scent glands, 
                    called castors, at the base of their tails. They use the secretions from these glands, a 
                    musk-like substance called castoreum, to mark territory.
